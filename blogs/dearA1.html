        <h1>Dear A</h1>
        <p>if it was in my hand to forgot you i would have done that a long time back

I know you don't feel same for me, but I atleast deserve to let you know that I'm madly in love with you

I'll meet you once in a decade, just to see you grow old and when we meet please wear this i can't have you for a lifetime but even one day will be enough to die happily

This pendent is for the happiest memory I can remember sitting beside you
You always hold a special place in my heart and I want you to remember this I hope you'll keep this with you. 

If I ever have a daughter I'll name her Anushka the love I can gave to this name is unimaginable

At last my favourite verse for my favourite girl-
And, I know you can't love me but
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
I'm still stuck in the moment with you
